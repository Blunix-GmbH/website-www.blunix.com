  - title: "How it works"
    content: |
      At Blunix, our goal is to enable our consultants to generate passive income, giving them the freedom to enhance their skills and create new products for our managed hosting clients. Your potential earnings have no ceiling; they depend solely on your ability to realistically manage multiple SLA customers.

      As a new joiner, you'll start with a base salary of €1000 per month (after tax). Each of our consultant is tasked with attracting new clients. We provide support and training in marketing to help you acquire new SLA clients. You are in charge from initiating contact with potential clients, through negotiating and signing Service Level Agreements, to managing migrations, infrastructure setups, and ongoing upgrades. Your cut is a fair percentage of the monthly revenue generated by each SLA client you manage. During absences, such as after your working hours, sickness or parental leave, your colleagues will handle your SLA clients, and you reciprocate. This collaborative approach ensures limitless earning potential based solely on your dedication and effort.
  - title: "Not a Classic Job"
    content: "Blunix offers unconventional employment opportunities, not traditional jobs with fixed salaries. If you aspire to earn more, we are here to support every step of your journey. Alternatively, if you prefer a lighter workload, managing just three or four SLA clients is also an option."
