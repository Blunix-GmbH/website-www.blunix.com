    title: "What Sets Us Apart"
    text: |
      Here are just a few ways we differ from other companies: Our infrastructure design makes it very easy to migrate to another hosting company. All pricing is negotiable. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we allowed delayed invoice payments for up to one year without interest and proactively offered discounts of up to 50% to clients facing financial difficulties - without them needing to ask for it.

      ### A Nerd-Factory, Not Just a IT-Company

      Blunix is dedicated to being a haven for Linux enthusiasts rather than a profit-driven entity. It's about enjoying the work we do with Linux and valuing the time we spend on it, not just the figures in our bank account.
